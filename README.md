## ðŸ“„ My Prep Document  
Iâ€™ve recently passed the AZ-104 exam and documented my real-world preparation experience in:

**[Az-104 - Real Experience 1.docx](https://github.com/fadiakkad/az104/blob/main/Az-104%20-%20Real%20Experience%201.docx)**

This document includes:
- Real exam insights and how I tackled various question types  
- Tables comparing key Azure services and features  
- Short notes on important topics  
- A quick-search guide to help find answers quickly in Microsoft Learn

This file helped me directly answer ~10 questions on the exam and significantly boosted my confidence.
